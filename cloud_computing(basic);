          why cloud computing:-
                                before cloud computing:-
                                                        let`s take an example , you want to host a website,these are the following

                                                              -Monitoring and maintenance of your servers.
                                                              
                                                        without cloudcomputiing has some Disadvantages:
                                                              -this setup expensive(own servers)
                                                              -troubleshooting problems can be tedious (monitoring the servers and

                                                              time.
                                                              
          Cloud Computing:-    how it happens now?
                                                         set up was very expensive:- put your data on cloud servers and voila! No
                                                             more buying expensive servers!             
                                                         Scalability! your server capacity will vary according to traffic, how

          What is cloud Computing?
                                        it is the use of remote servers on the internet to storer ,manage and process data rather

         Cloud models:                  1)Service Models
                                        2)Deployement Models          
                                                  
                                                  
 1)Service Models:-  3 kind of sevice module -infrastractur as a service(IaaS) 
                                             -platform as a service (PaaS)
                                             -software as a service(SaaS)
                     
                     -IaaS:-Provides virtualized computing resource over the internet
                           -No worries about the underfyinig physical mach8ine
                           -Abstract the userform the physical machine
                           -get the access of the operating system
                           
                     -PaaS:-don`t get access of os.
                           -No control over underfying architecture including operating system, storage,servers etc;
                           -The cloud Provider gives the ability to the custome to deploy customer created application 
                              using programming languages,tools etc that are provided by the cloud Provider.
                     -SaaS:-Don`t get a server,dont get a user interface jjust get a software
                              -Cloud provider leases applications or software which are qwned by them to its client
                              -example:salesforce.com provides the CRM(Customer Relation Manager) on a cloud infrastructure
                              to its client and charges them for it,but the software is owned by the company only.
                              
                              
  2)Deployment Models:- public cloud,hybrid cloud, private cloud
