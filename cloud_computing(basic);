          What is cloud Computing?
                                        it is the use of remote servers on the internet to storer ,manage and process data rather

         Cloud models:                  1)Service Models
                                        2)Deployement Models          
                                                  
                                                  
 1)Service Models:-  3 kind of sevice module -infrastractur as a service(IaaS) 
                                             -platform as a service (PaaS)
                                             -software as a service(SaaS)
                     
                     -IaaS:-Provides virtualized computing resource over the internet
                           -No worries about the underfyinig physical mach8ine
                           -Abstract the userform the physical machine
                           -get the access of the operating system
                           
                     -PaaS:-don`t get access of os.
                           -No control over underfying architecture including operating system, storage,servers etc;
                           -The cloud Provider gives the ability to the custome to deploy customer created application 
                              using programming languages,tools etc that are provided by the cloud Provider.
                     -SaaS:-Don`t get a server,dont get a user interface jjust get a software
                              -Cloud provider leases applications or software which are qwned by them to its client
                              -example:salesforce.com provides the CRM(Customer Relation Manager) on a cloud infrastructure
                              to its client and charges them for it,but the software is owned by the company only.
